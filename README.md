# Welcome to MIPT 2023 Matching course

## Description
This is the first run of Matching course at IDA department.

The course focuses on how to make ML systems useful for the industry - from collecting/labeling data and building its regular supply, to monitoring indicators and evaluating the effectiveness of algorithms.
 
The topic will be considered on the example of the matching problem (search for identical objects), namely, the search for identical goods on marketplace.
 
Emphasis will be placed on the differences in problem solving approaches within training courses and approaches in the industry: specific quality measures of interest to business will be considered, as well as learning algorithms and error functions that allow the production of models with good performance of these quality metrics. In other words, the course is not about how to train a model, but about how to build a system that benefits a business based on it.
